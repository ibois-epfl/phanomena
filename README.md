# Phanomena

This is the repository for storing Phanomena project files related to coding e.g. Grasshopper (.ghx), Python, C# files.
We refer to the following folder on the server: "@\\enac1files.epfl.ch\IBOIS\187_Ph√§nomena " .
Document each uploaded files with a small comment and an image in the readme below.
The GitHub repository is necessary for code to avoid the clutter on the server, that should normally be used only for drawings and large rhino files.

#### github usage helper:

to send the files:
``` bash
git add --all
git commit -m "PREFIX message name"
git push

"FIX detailed explanation what has been done " - bug fix, e.g. grasshopper file change
